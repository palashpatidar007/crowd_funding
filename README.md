## ðŸš€ Quick Start with uv (Python + Node.js)

This project supports [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reproducible installs for both Python and Node.js.

### 1. Install uv (if not already installed)
```sh
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment
```sh
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python dependencies
```sh
uv pip sync  # Installs from requirements.txt into .venv
```

### 4. Install Node.js dependencies (in both client and server)
```sh
cd server
uv npm install

cd ../client
uv npm install
```

### 5. Run the project

#### Backend
```sh
cd server
uv npm run dev
```

#### Frontend
```sh
cd client
uv npm start
```

---

- You get a fully isolated Python environment (`.venv`).
- Node.js dependencies are managed with `uv npm install`.
- All team members can use the same commands for a reproducible setup.
